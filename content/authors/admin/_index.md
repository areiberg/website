## About Me

My work focuses on digital policy and and sovereign data ecosystems. I currently serve as a project lead at acatech – National Academy of Science and Engineering, where I lead the Gaia-X Hub Germany. The Hub acts as the national point of contact for the Gaia-X initiative, supporting the creation of secure and interoperable data infrastructures. Before joining acatech, I worked at the German media authorities, contributing to the regulation of digital platforms. Earlier, I conducted research on digital policy at several academic institutions. My doctoral dissertation offers an overview of the early years of german digital policy, with a particular emphasis on policy analysis using text mining methods.
